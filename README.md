# NewWave-script

Here there are all the script needed for the Figure 1(B,C,D) and supplementary Figure 1,2. Scripts are ordered in that way.

All the path has been substitute with "/path/to/file" but all the file mentioned in the scripts has been created with one preavious script or in case of 01_DataExtraction.R and 19_SupplementaryPlot2.R downloading those object.

In order to measure the RAM consumption you need to use a Linux system with collectl installed(https://linux.die.net/man/1/collectl).
Files named with "MemoryRegisterXXXXX" will run the corresponding file "MemoryXXXXX" and will save the results on a text file.
In order to use 08_plot3.R you will need to run the corresponding MemoryRegister script 4 times, 1 for each number of cores, you need to remember to change the arguments and the name of output files each time.
In order to use 17_plot4.R you will need to run the corresponding MemoryRegister script 6 times, 1 for each number of cell, you need to remember to change the arguments and the name of output files each time.

In the txt file containing the ram consumption that will be generated by MemoryRegister files you need to delete the first row, every occurrance of the line "# PROCESS SUMMARY (counters are /sec)" and the character # before the line of header. This must be done manually for each txt file in order to import them correctly.
